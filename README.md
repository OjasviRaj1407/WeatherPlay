# Match Suitability Predictor

Welcome to the **Match Suitability Predictor** project! This web application predicts whether itâ€™s suitable to play a match based on weather conditions. Built with Python Flask, HTML, and CSS, it integrates a pre-trained Gaussian Naive Bayes machine learning model for accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning into a web application. The application uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes model to analyze weather conditions and determine match suitability. The interface is user-friendly and built with Flask for seamless interaction.

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes model to predict match suitability.
- **Multi-Page Interface**: Developed with Flask, HTML, and CSS for an intuitive user experience.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides immediate feedback based on user input.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Server-side scripting and machine learning integration.
- **Flask**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
