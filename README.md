# Weather-Prediction-Model
The goal of this project is to create a simple machine learning model that can predict whether itâ€™s suitable to play a match based on weather conditions. The algorithm used for this is the Naive Bayes Classifier, specifically the Gaussian Naive Bayes variant, which is a common method for making predictions based on probabilities
